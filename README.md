How it Works
You have 10 chances to guess letters that are in the Vacation Spot name. With any incorrect guesses, the letters will be displayed so as not to choose the same letters again. With every incorrect guess, the guesses you have remaining decreases by 1. If you spell out the element name and have guesses remaining, you increase your wins by 1. If you are unable to guess the Vacation Spot and run out of guesses, your losses increase by 1 point.
